      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a small island surrounded by the emerald sea of coffee beans, Seanless lived a life of contentment. In this paradise of solitude, the silence was broken by a single touch from the emerald sea—his finger dried into wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of books had been read in the island’s library. As he studied the curse, he discovered that it could only be cured by a spirit dwelling in the aquamarine sea. He was confused for a moment, for—by the moon—that sea could be seen from his view, yet there was no way to reach it. After all, it was located just beside the emerald sea. However, a massive crater sat in the middle! Thus, he was truly in distress, for he would need to brave all seven seas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wind was calm, drifting through the sails of the wooden, purple ship. It was clear that a pirate vessel was approaching the border of the Topaz Sea&amp;mdash;a sea where lands were barren and fruits no longer prospered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seanless, meanwhile, was staring at his fingers&amp;mdash;two wooden fingers, rather. Sweat poured down his cheek, for the curse had begun infecting his hand slowly. He attempted to wrap them with linen cloth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
