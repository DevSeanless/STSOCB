As he studied the curse, he discovered that it could only be cured by a spirit dwelling in the aquamarine sea. He was confused for a moment, for—by the moon—that sea could be seen from his view, yet there was no way to reach it. After all, it was located just beside the emerald sea. However, a massive crater sat in the middle! Thus, he was truly in distress, for he would need to brave all seven seas.\nIn the history of Cobeanadia, there had been only one person who had accomplished such a feat—it was Captain Kay, the Sea Bean Queen!…\nAs he pondered the history of the world, the bell of the lighthouse rang loudly. He assumed it might be the monthly visitor to the island, who usually arrived like clockwork. But today was different—it was ten days early. Seanless, with no choice, was forced to welcome the visitor unprepared.\nHe ran quickly, reached the dock, and saw a huge ship anchored at the shore. He tried shouting, knocked on every cabin, yet no one answered. As he wandered around the empty ship, he finally found someone lying near the rudder. Purple long coat, tanned skin, brunette hair… “By the moon! A dead person!” Seanless exclaimed. But he felt immediate remorse when the figure groaned… “Coooofffffeeeee.”\nLater, under the silver moonlight shining through the dark, empty sky, Seanless poured brewed coffee into a cup. “Who are you?” he asked.\nThe woman before him appeared carefree, sniffing her coffee. “Thanks to the moon!” she said. Seanless, meanwhile, rolled his eyes, only then remembering something important. He took a breath and asked again, “Can I borrow your ship?”\nSeanless had been stuck on the island for years, ever since his childhood. It was a must for the people who lived by the Emerald Sea, for they had to follow tradition—to become full-fledged Artisans, supplying the other five seas with coffee. After all, only the Emerald Sea could be refined into true coffee.\nIt was also Seanless’s livelihood. And for some foolish reason, he had made a grave mistake. He had accidentally touched the freshly harvested sea beans. Now, he needed to take a break from being an Artisan and focus on curing himself.\nThe woman’s brow curled. She smiled. “If you give me ten barrels of coffee powder, I can even guide you to the place you want to go.”\n“That’s a month’s worth of supplies!” Seanless replied.\n“Then no ship for you,” said the woman.\nSeanless was irritated—yet… he had no choice, or he would literally turn into wood. “Alright, I want to go to the Aquamarine Sea.” The pirate lady smiled, turned pale, then a cold sweat trickled down her cheek as she said, “Ammm… you could make that fifteen barrels.”\n“No,” replied Seanless flatly.\n“But… it’s the Aquamarine Sea…” the pirate woman protested. “The last and most dangerous coffee bean sea of all! It’s the realm of the spirits. We don’t even know what creatures live there!”\nSeanless looked reluctant and said, “Uh-huh. Then no coffee for you, Pirate…”\n“Tsk… Alright then! Pleased to meet you—I’m Captain Kyla, the brave adventurer of the sea!” she declared.\nAs the two settled their contract, Seanless closed the borders of the island and added signage to indicate it was off-limits to traders.\nMeanwhile, Captain Kyla appeared displeased with the decision, yet she continued to sail her ship toward the Topaz Sea of Coffee Beans.\n",
