The wind was calm, drifting through the sails of the wooden, purple ship. It was clear that a pirate vessel was approaching the border of the Topaz Sea—a sea where lands were barren and fruits no longer prospered.

Seanless, meanwhile, was staring at his fingers—two wooden fingers, rather. Sweat poured down his cheek, for the curse had begun infecting his hand slowly. He attempted to wrap them with linen cloth.

“Seanless, come out!” A knock and a voice echoed in his cabin. He stood up, hastily wrapping his hand, and then reached for the door.

“What is it, Captain Kyla? Do you need more help or something?” Seanless replied with a forced polite voice. He then muttered under his breath, “I’ve been your errand boy since I boarded this ship…”

“Go fold the sails for me,” Kyla ordered. “We’ve just reached the Topaz Sea. After that, join me down in the hold.”

“Aye… aye, Captain…” Seanless replied, rolling his eyes.

Seanless was in a constant battle with himself—he abhorred the experience he had. Most of the time, he was tasked with chores: cleaning the captain’s cabin, brewing her coffee, and the cruelest task of all—guarding the ship like a madman through the night.

On some nights he had also noticed the Captain didn’t seem to sleep at all! He did want to hand some tasks to her sometimes. But he couldn't, for she seemed restless. He let it pass, after all, he needed her more than ever now. The curse gnawed at him more than Captain Kyla ever did.

The sun began to hide from the sky—half of it fell in the east while the other sank into the west, dragging the heavens into dusk. At the center of the sky, a shadowy line began to form, along with a circular shape becoming visible. The moon was taking its place in the heavens, and with it, evening was arriving like a silent spell.

After wrestling with the sails for a long while, Seanless suddenly sensed a change in the atmosphere. The hair on his skin stood on end. He then descended to the hold as instructed. Down there, the air felt suffocating, and his hair began to rise and point in different directions.

Meanwhile, Kyla was gripping two levers and pushing them forward. She was sweating and exhausted. From the look of her, she was having a hard time. Her hair—like his—was flying in every direction. Then she noticed him.

Seanless ran toward her, tense and alarmed. “What’s happening, Captain Kyla?” Seanless asked, sweating like a cold water bottle.

“Seanless, QUICK!” Kyla shouted. “Grab this lever and push it with me. Hurry!”

Seanless meanwhile was confused, yet Kyla looked at him, “Just push it forward—no questions! Hurry!”

Seanless grabbed the left lever. Kyla was pushing the right one, and together they shoved them forward with all their strength. The levers began to hinge and sway from the force.

Suddenly, a tingling sensation surged through their bodies. “Don’t you dare stop pushing, Seanless!” Captain Kyla screamed.

Dusk had ended before they knew it. From the window, a starless sky was visible. Moonlight struck their faces. Both lay on the wooden floor, staring breathlessly at the ceiling. Sweat dotted the planks beneath them.

“What was that!? I thought I was going to be fried!” Seanless shouted in a frenzy.

He crawled toward Kyla, but as he reached her, she was cold. Chillingly like a corpse. He stared at her in alarm and saw her weary eyes blinking faintly. She weakly grabbed his arm and fought not to close her eyes. But in the end, she succumbed and fell unconscious.

“Ugh! Now I can say I’m babysitting a full-grown woman!” he said.

Seanless slung Kyla over his back and trudged toward the exit of the hold with all his might. As he reached the main deck, the wind blew so fiercely it nearly knocked him over. Then he noticed—the ship was floating. Was it because of the levers they had pulled? he wondered. Yet no one answered. What truly caught his attention was the glowing light beneath the ship.

Step by step, Seanless battled the raging wind while carrying the only hope he had left against the cursed fingers. He reached the edge of the front deck and his eyes widened—By the moon!—at the sight of the vast Topaz Sea.

“No wonder our hair stood up!” Seanless muttered. “If I’d traveled alone, I would’ve seen my soul in the darkest depth of the crater”

The Topaz Sea was blazing with electric energy—enough to fry any living creature.
