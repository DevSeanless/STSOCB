On a small island surrounded by the emerald sea of coffee beans, Seanless lived a life of contentment. In a paradise of solidarity, the silence was disrupted by a single touch of the emerald sea—his arms dried into wood.

Thousands of books had been read in the island’s library. As he studied the curse, he found that it could only be cured by the spirit that dwelled in the aquamarine sea. He was confused for a moment, for—by the moon—that sea was near yet far. Located beside the emerald sea, divided by a massive crater! Hence, he needed to brave all the seven seas. There was only one person in history who had done that—it was Captain Kay!

The bell of the light post rang loud as the monthly visitor of the island usually came. But it was a bit unusual today—it was ten days early. Seanless was forced to welcome the visitor unprepared. He reached the dock and saw a huge ship anchored to the shore.
There, as he spent time around the empty ship, he finally found someone lying at the rudder. Purple long coat, tanned skin, brunette hair… “Yikes, dead person!” Seanless exclaimed. But he felt remorse when it spoke to him… “Coooofffffeeeee.”

Later, under the moonlight of the silver moon, Seanless poured brewed coffee into a cup.
“Who are you?” asked Seanless.

The woman in front of him seemed carefree, sniffing her coffee. “Thanks to the moon!” she said.

Seanless, meanwhile, rolled his eyes and remembered something important. He took a breath and asked a second time, “Can I borrow your ship?”

Seanless had been stuck on the island for years since his childhood. It was a must for the people who lived in the Emerald Sea to be artisans, for this had been a tradition—supplying the other six seas with coffee. Only the emerald sea could be refined into coffee, after all. This was the bread and butter for Seanless. And for some stupid reason, he made a mistake. He accidentally touched the freshly taken sea beans. Now he needed to take a break from being an artisan and take care of himself.

The lady’s brow curled up. She smiled. “If you give me ten barrels of coffee, I can even guide you to the place you want to go.”

“That’s a month’s worth of supplies!” Seanless replied.

“Then no ship for you,” said the lady.

Seanless was irritated, yet… he had no choice, or he would become literally wood. “Alright, I wanted to go to the aquamarine sea!”

The pirate lady smiled, turned pale, and a cold sweat dropped down her cheek as she said, “Ammm… you could do fifteen barrels for that.”

“No,” replied Seanless.

“But… it’s the aquamarine sea… the last and most dangerous coffee bean sea of all! It’s the realm of the spirits. We don’t know what creatures live there!”

Seanless seemed reluctant and said, “No, and no coffee to you, Pirate…?”

“Tsk… Alright! I’m Captain Kyle… The brave adventurer of the sea!” she answered.

As the two settled with their contracts, Seanless closed the border of the island, indicating that the island was closed for traders. Meanwhile, Captain Kyle seemed unhappy with the decision, yet sailed her ship to the Topaz Sea of Coffee Bean.
