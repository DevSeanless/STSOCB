On a small island surrounded by the emerald sea of coffee beans, Seanless lived a life of contentment. In this paradise of solidarity, silence was disrupted by a single touch of the emerald sea—his finger dried into wood.

Thousands of books had been read in the island’s library. As he studied the curse, he found that it could only be cured by the spirit dwelling in the aquamarine sea. He was confused for a moment, for—by the moon—that sea could be seen from his view, yet there was zero chance to reach it. After all, it was just located beside the emerald sea. However, a massive crater was sitting in the middle! Hence, he was really in distress, for he needed to brave all seven seas.

In the history of Cobeanadia, there had only been one person who had done it all—it was Captain Kay, the Sea Bean Queen!...

The bell of the lighthouse rang loudly as the monthly visitor of the island usually arrived. But it was a bit unusual that day—it was ten days early. Seanless, with no choice, was forced to welcome the visitor unprepared.
He ran quickly, reached the dock, and saw a huge ship anchored to the shore. He tried to shout, knocked on every cabin, and yet, no one answered. As he spent time around the empty ship, he finally found someone lying nearby the rudder. Purple long coat, tanned skin, brunette hair… “Yikes, a dead person!” Seanless exclaimed. But he felt even more remorse when it spoke to him… “Coooofffffeeeee.”

Later, under the silver moonlight shining through the dark empty sky, Seanless poured brewed coffee into a cup. “Who are you?” he asked.

The woman in front of him seemed carefree, sniffing her coffee. “Thanks to the moon!” she said.

Seanless, meanwhile, rolled his eyes, only then remembering something important. He took a breath and asked a second time, “Can I borrow your ship?”

Seanless had been stuck on the island for years since his childhood. It was a must for the people who lived in the Emerald Sea, for they needed to follow the tradition—to become a full-fledged Artisan—supplying the other five seas with coffee. After all, only the Emerald Sea could be refined into coffee.

It was also the bread and butter for Seanless. And for some stupid reason, he had made a mistake. He had accidentally touched the freshly harvested sea beans. Now he needed to take a break from being an artisan and take care of himself.

The lady’s brow curled. She smiled. “If you give me ten barrels of coffee, I can even guide you to the place you want to go.”

“That’s a month’s worth of supplies!” Seanless replied.

“Then no ship for you,” said the lady.

Seanless was irritated, yet… he had no choice, or he would literally become wood. “Alright, I want to go to the aquamarine sea!”

The pirate lady smiled, turned pale, then a cold sweat dropped down her cheek as she said, “Ammm… you could do fifteen barrels for that.”

“No,” replied Seanless.

“But… it’s the aquamarine sea…” ranted the lady pirate. “The last and most dangerous coffee bean sea of all! It’s the realm of the spirits. We don’t know what creatures live there!”

Seanless seemed reluctant and said, “Uhuh, then no coffee to you, Pirate…”

“Tsk… Alright then! Pleased to meet you, I’m Captain Kyla… the brave adventurer of the sea!” she answered.

As the two settled their contract, Seanless closed the borders of the island and added signage to indicate that it was closed for traders.

Meanwhile, Captain Kyla seemed unhappy with the decision, yet she continued to sail her ship to the Topaz Sea of Coffee Beans.
